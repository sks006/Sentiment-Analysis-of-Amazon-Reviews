# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews

## Project Description

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project for Amazon reviews. It uses the **AFINN lexicon** for sentiment scoring and **TextBlob** for polarity and subjectivity analysis. The project includes data preprocessing, sentiment classification, and interactive visualizations for insights.

---

## Features

- **Custom Sentiment Scoring**: Use the AFINN lexicon to classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes non-alphabetical characters and standardizes text for analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Sentiment distribution through bar and pie charts.
  - Word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
  - Polarity vs. Subjectivity scatter plot using TextBlob.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly and Seaborn provide engaging data exploration tools.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `nltk`
  - `textblob`
  - `wordcloud`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `cufflinks`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your dataset**:
   - Place your Amazon reviews dataset (e.g., `amazon_reviews.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset has a column named `reviewText`.

4. **Add the AFINN lexicon file**:
   - Place the `AFINN-111.txt` file in the root directory.
   - Update its file path in the script, if necessary.

## Usage

### Running the Sentiment Analysis

1. **Upload the dataset**:
   Use the provided code snippet to upload your dataset if using Google Colab:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```

2. **Preprocess the data**:
   The script will clean the text in the `reviewText` column, removing non-alphabetical characters and converting to lowercase.

3. **Sentiment Classification**:
   Reviews are classified based on the AFINN lexicon:
   - Positive
   - Negative
   - Neutral

4. **Visualize Results**:
   - Sentiment distribution via bar and pie charts.
   - Word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
   - Polarity vs. subjectivity scatter plot.

5. **Generate Output**:
   The script outputs a DataFrame with the following columns:
   - `reviewText`: Cleaned review text.
   - `sentiment`: Sentiment label (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
   - `polarity`: Sentiment polarity score from TextBlob.
   - `subjectivity`: Sentiment subjectivity score from TextBlob.
